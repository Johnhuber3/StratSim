                    Baccarat is a card game that originated in Italy in the 15th century. The game was later introduced to France, where it gained popularity among the nobility and has since spread to casinos around the world. Baccarat is a game played between two hands, the "player" and the "banker". The goal of the game is to predict which hand will have a higher score, with the highest score being nine. Players can also place bets on a tie between the two hands. The game is played with a deck of cards, with the face cards and tens having a value of zero and the rest of the cards having their face value. The value of a hand is determined by adding up the values of the individual cards and then taking only the last digit of the sum as the score. Baccarat is often considered a sophisticated and high-class game, and it is often associated with the wealthy and elite. It is often played in a separate, roped-off area of the casino known as the "baccarat pit", which is typically reserved for high rollers and VIPs. The game is often associated with luxury and glamour, and it has been featured in many movies and television shows as a symbol of sophistication and exclusivity.

                    Table layout:<br/><br/>
                    In Baccarate player sit at a curved table all facing a dealer. The table is divided into three betting areas, labeled "player". "banker", and "tie". Each betting area corresponds to one of the three possible outcomes of the game. In front of that there are two sections for the dealer to play out the player and banker hands respectively.<br/><br/>

                    Types of bets:<br/><br/>
                    Baccarat is one of the most simple games in the casino and there are traditionally only three things that you can bet on. This is banker, player and tie. Betting on a tie has a payout of 8 to 1. Betting on player or banker has a payout of 1 to 1 except for banker has a 5% comission. The banker holds a slight advantage in Baccarat.<br/><br/>
                    How the game works:<br/><br/>
                    Here is a guide to when the player or banker hits and stands. I feel the game is easier to follow with the guide below rather than writing out the rules step by step.<br/>

                    Getting chips:<br/><br/>
                    When you walk up to a Baccarat table you can either give the dealer cash or chips that you previously had from a different game. They will then give you chips at face value in the denomination breakdown of your choosing. For example, if you walk up with $500 you can ask for $100 in $5 chips and $400 in $25 dollar chips.<br/><br/>
                    Placing bets:<br/><br/>
                    Before the hand is delt you place your wager on what you think the outcome will be. Once the dealer begin you cannot change your bet.<br/><br/>
                    Dealing:<br/><br/>
                    In Baccarat there is no input from the player after the dealing starts. The dealer will do everything themselves. All the player does is simply predict the result. For the exaclt rules of the game and how the game is dealt specifically see the above rules section.<br/><br/>
                    Collecting Winnings:<br/><br/>
                    After the dealer has paid out all the players at the table you can tell the dealer that you are done playing and would like to "color up". They will take your chips, count them, report the amount and give you the highest denomination chips possible for the amount that you have. You can take these chips to another game or cash them out at the cage.
